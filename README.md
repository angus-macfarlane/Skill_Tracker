# Skill_Tracker

This is a work in progress. The end goal is to have a program with a GUI that a user can input skills they are working on and track the amount of time they've been working on them. This is a collaboration with Michael Nix. 

UPDATE (11 DECEMBER 2021):
- We refactored the code and simplified it a lot (thanks to Mark Redd). 
- We switched from Pickle to JSON. 
- Next up: 
  - Add signals to the GUI so the user knows what to do. 
  - Add in some error handling.
